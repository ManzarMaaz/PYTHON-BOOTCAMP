# 🃏 Flashy - Flash Card App (Capstone Project)

This project is my **Capstone Project** for the Python Bootcamp 🚀.  
It’s a fully functional **Flash Card App** built with Python, designed to make **language learning interactive and effective**.  

The app uses a flash card system to test French vocabulary and automatically tracks progress by saving unknown/known words.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Randomly displays French words  
- ✅ Auto-flip after 3 seconds to reveal English meaning  
- ✅ Mark words as known/unknown with ✅ / ❌ buttons  
- ✅ Saves progress in `Remaining_words.csv` so you don’t repeat learned words  
- ✅ Beautiful Tkinter GUI with images for cards and buttons

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** → for GUI  
- **Pandas** → for CSV data handling  
- **Random** → for card shuffling

## 🎯 How It Works
1. A random **French word** is shown on the card.  
2. After 3 seconds, the card **flips** to reveal the English translation.  
3. Click ✅ if you know the word → it’s removed from the learning set.  
4. Click ❌ if you don’t → it stays in rotation.  
5. Progress is automatically saved in `Remaining_words.csv`.
