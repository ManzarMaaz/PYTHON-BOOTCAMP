# 🕌 Quran Vocabulary Flash Card App (Capstone Project)

A **Python-based Flash Card App** designed to help learners memorize the **100+ most frequent words from the Qur’an**.  
This project goes beyond simple flash cards — each card includes:

- **Arabic Word**
- **Transliteration**
- **English Meaning**
- **Frequency of Occurrence in the Qur’an**
- **Part of Speech (POS)**

The app uses an **auto-flip system**: after 3 seconds, the Arabic word flips to reveal the English meaning.  
Learners can mark words as ✅ *known* or ❌ *unknown*, and the app automatically saves progress in `remaining_arabic.csv`.
