# üß† Python Bootcamp - Challenges

Welcome to the **Challenges** section of my Python Bootcamp journey!  
This folder contains hands-on coding exercises I‚Äôve completed as part of my learning and internship with **CodSoft**.

Each challenge focuses on a core concept of Python ‚Äî including loops, control flow, and logical problem-solving.

## üîç Folder Overview

| Challenge Name        | Description                                                  | Key Concepts                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Escaping the Maze     | Navigate through a maze using if/else conditions             | Control flow, while loops   |
| Hurdle (For Loop)     | Jump over obstacles using a fixed loop                       | `for` loop, logic building  |
| Hurdle (While Loop)   | Similar hurdle logic using `while` for dynamic movement      | `while` loop, conditions    |
| Hurdle v3             | Optimized hurdle solver with added checks                    | Logical thinking, refactor  |
| Hurdle v4             | Final version with advanced decision-making and efficiency   | Flow control, optimization  |

## üìå Goals of These Challenges

- ‚úÖ Build **problem-solving** and **algorithmic** thinking
- ‚úÖ Practice Python **control structures** and **loops**
- ‚úÖ Learn to write clean, documented code
- ‚úÖ Improve versioning with each iteration (v1 ‚Üí v4)

## üí° How to Use This Folder

Each subfolder includes:
- A clear **README.md** with the problem description
- My **Python solution** (`.py` file)
- Comments and logic walkthrough inside the code
