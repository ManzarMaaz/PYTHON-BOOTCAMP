# 🏓 Pong Py — Classic Pong Game in Python

A simple, fun, and fully playable Pong game built with Python's `turtle` graphics module.  
Perfect for learning object-oriented programming concepts, collision detection, and game loop logic.

---

## 🎮 Features
- **Two-player control** — W/S keys for Player 1, Arrow keys for Player 2.
- **Scoreboard** — Tracks left and right player points.
- **Ball physics** — Bounces off walls and paddles.
- **Game boundaries** — Resets when the ball goes out of bounds.
- **Clean OOP structure** — Separated into multiple classes:
  - `Paddle`
  - `Ball`
  - `Scoreboard`
  - Main game loop (`main.py`)
