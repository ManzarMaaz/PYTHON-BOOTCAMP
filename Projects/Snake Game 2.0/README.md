# 🐍 Py Snake Game 2.0

A simple Snake Game built in Python using the `turtle` graphics module.  
This project is part of my journey through Angela Yu's **100 Days of Python Bootcamp**.

## 🎮 Features
- Classic Snake mechanics (move with **WASD** keys).  
- Food spawns randomly on the board.  
- Snake grows every time it eats food.  
- Scoreboard tracks **current score** and **high score**.  
- High score is saved in a `data.txt` file and persists across game runs.  
- Collision detection with walls and snake tail.
