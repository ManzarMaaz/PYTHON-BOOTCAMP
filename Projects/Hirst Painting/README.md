# ðŸŽ¨ Turtle Dot Painting with Python

This project recreates a colorful 10x10 dot painting using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module.  
Inspired by Damien Hirst-style art, each dot is randomly colored from a curated RGB palette.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Files

- `dot_painting.py` â€” main script for generating the dot grid
- No external images or data files required
- RGB color list is manually defined

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Draws a 10x10 grid of dots
- Uses random RGB values for a vibrant effect
- Simulates brush strokes moving row by row
- Hides turtle for a clean drawing
- Exits cleanly on mouse click

---

Colors are random and different each time you run it.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts Practiced

- `turtle` graphics (motion, color, dot)
- Using RGB color mode (`turtle.colormode(255)`)
- Controlling turtle orientation with `setheading()`
- Row-by-row logic using loops
- Working with tuples and `random.choice()`
