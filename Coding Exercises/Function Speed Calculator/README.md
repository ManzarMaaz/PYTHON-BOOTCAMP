# ‚è±Ô∏è Function Speed Calculator (Python Decorator Example)

This simple Python script demonstrates how to use **decorators** to measure and display the **execution time** of functions. It‚Äôs a great example for learning Python‚Äôs decorator syntax and how to time code performance.

---

## üìú Code Overview

The program defines a custom decorator `speed_calc_decorator()` that measures how long a given function takes to run.
It then applies this decorator to two functions ‚Äî one **fast** and one **slow** ‚Äî to compare their speeds.

```python
import time
current_time = time.time()
print(current_time)  # seconds since Jan 1st, 1970

def speed_calc_decorator(function):
    start = current_time
    function()
    end = time.time()
    diff = end - start
    print(f'{function.__name__} run speed: {diff}s\n')
    return function

@speed_calc_decorator
def fast_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        i * i

@speed_calc_decorator
def slow_function():
    for i in range(10000000):
        i * i

fast_function()
slow_function()
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **`speed_calc_decorator()`**

   * Records the time before and after running the target function.
   * Calculates the difference and prints how long it took.

2. **Decorators (@ syntax)**

   * Used to "wrap" functions, allowing additional behavior (like timing) without modifying the function itself.

3. **Test Functions**

   * `fast_function()` ‚Äî loops a million times.
   * `slow_function()` ‚Äî loops ten million times.
   * The output shows that the slow function takes longer.

## üí° Example Output

```
1730050847.321044  # current Unix timestamp
fast_function run speed: 0.037s

slow_function run speed: 0.338s
```

*(Your exact times will vary depending on your system.)*

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/function-speed-decorator.git
   cd function-speed-decorator
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python speed_calculator.py
   ```

---

## üß© Possible Improvements

* Fix the decorator to calculate start time **inside** the decorator call instead of using `current_time`.
* Return the function‚Äôs result from the decorator.
* Format output times for better readability.
